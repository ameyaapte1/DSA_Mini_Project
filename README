RSA has been implemented using a multiple precision library.
Most of the features are similar to the  "openssl rsa" utility, the same has been used for testing corectness of keys and file format.
"genrsa" generates private key and store it in DER or PEM format (default).It also generates public key from private keys.

DER format uses ASN.1 (Abstract syntax notation) to represent modulus, exponent and all other componenets or RSA keys.
PEM format is more popular and it is BASE64 representation of DER format.
Both of these formats are supported by OpenSSL.

For more information about both the formats:

The "enc" utility can read DER/PEM files and encrypt/decrypt files using the RSA algorithm.

Whats not supported:

RSA public keys are not compliant with OpenSSL and PEM format is not supported.

Dependencies:
